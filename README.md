# Overview

Welcome to PromptlyTech's RAG Hub!
The PromptlyTech RAG
PromptlyTech RAG (Recision RAG) is your go-to repository for developing enterprise-level RAG (Prompt Tuning) systems. 
This GitHub project aims to advance the field of prompt engineering, with a focus on Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. 
Our mission at PromptlyTech is to make AI-powered solutions more accessible, efficient, and effective for a variety of industries.

## üöÄ Key Services
- **Automatic Prompt Generation service:** Streamlining the creation of effective prompts, reducing the time and expertise required to craft prompts manually.

- **Automatic Test Case Generation Service:** Automating the creation of various test cases to improve the reliability and performance of llm applications.
- **Prompt Testing and Ranking Service:** Evaluating and ranking different prompts based on effectiveness, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses.


## üåê Background Context
In the dynamic world of artificial intelligence, the quality of prompts is critical to the effectiveness of LLMS. Prompt engineering, 
the craft of creating queries or statements to guide llms, has become an essential skill. 
In this repository addresses the challenges of prompt engineering, automation, and optimization for more effective use of llms.
